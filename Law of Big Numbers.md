guarantees that **as your sample size increases**, empirical deviations from the true population distribution become statistically negligible. Specifically:

#### Weak Law of Large Numbers
For i.i.d. random variables $X_1, X_2, ..., X_n$ with finite expectation $\mu$ :

$$
\lim_{n \to \infty} P\left(\left|\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n X_i - \mu\right| \geq \varepsilon \right) = 0 \quad \text{for any } \varepsilon > 0
$$

*Interpretation*: The sample mean converges in probability to the population mean.

#### Strong Law of Large Numbers
Strengthens this to almost sure convergence:

$$
P\left(\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n X_i = \mu \right) = 1
$$

#### Statistics beyound mean

- You can proove mathematically that all other descriptional statistics (momentums) will converge to fit general population as well
- Congergense rates are slowing down, as you increase the moment:

### Convergence Rates
1. **[[mathematical expectation]] (1st Moment)** 
	- **Convergence Rate**: $O(1/\sqrt{n})$
	- **Why**: [[Central Limit Theorem (CLT)]] guarantees $\sqrt{n}(\bar{X}_n - \mu) \to N(0, \sigma^2)$.
2. **[[variance]] (2nd Moment)** 
	- **Convergence Rate**: $O(1/\sqrt{n})$ but with larger variance
	- **Why**: Depends on $E[X^4]$, which amplifies noise.
3. **[[skewness]] (3rd Moment)** 
	- **Convergence Rate**: $O(1/\sqrt{n})$ but even slower 
	- **Why**: Depends on $E[X^6]$, which is often much larger.
4. **[[kurtosis]] (4th Moment)** 
	- **Convergence Rate**: $O(1/\sqrt{n})$ but slowest
	- **Why**: Depends on $E[X^8]$, which can be extremely large.


### Intuition
- **Mean**: Only requires $E[X^2] < \infty$ (finite variance). 
- **Variance**: Requires $E[X^4] < \infty$. 
- **Skewness/Kurtosis**: Require even higher moments ($E[X^6]$, $E[X^8]$). 

Higher moments **amplify outliers**, making them noisier and slower to stabilize.

### Empirical Example
For a standard normal distribution ($\mu = 0$, $\sigma^2 = 1$, skewness = 0, kurtosis = 3):

| Statistic  | True Value | Sample Size for Â±5% Error |
|-------------|------------|---------------------------|
| Mean    | 0     | ~100               |
| Variance  | 1     | ~1,000             |
| Skewness  | 0     | ~10,000          |
| Kurtosis  | 3     | ~100,000         |


### Practical Implications for ML/Statistics
1. **Dataset Size Matters** Small samples ($n < 30$) may show significant deviations from population parameters. LLN explains why:
	  - Training/validation splits should be large enough
	  - Bootstrapping works better with larger $n$

2. **Validation of i.i.d. Assumption** If your data violates i.i.d. (e.g., time-series dependencies), LLN conclusions become unreliable.

Absolutely! Let me break it down step by step:

---

### **What Are Error Bars?**
Error bars are graphical representations of the variability or uncertainty in data. They often show:
- **Standard Error (SE)**: How much the sample mean might fluctuate around the true population mean.
- **Confidence Intervals (CI)**: A range where the true mean is likely to lie.

---

### **Standard Error Formula**
The standard error of the mean (SEM) is calculated as:
\[
\text{SEM} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}
\]
- \( \sigma \): Population standard deviation (spread of the data)
- \( n \): Sample size (number of observations)

---

### **Why Does SEM Shrink as \( n \) Grows?**
1. **Intuition**:  
   - Larger samples (\( n \)) provide more information about the population.  
   - More data points reduce the uncertainty in estimating the true mean.

2. **Mathematically**:  
   - The denominator \( \sqrt{n} \) grows as \( n \) increases.  
   - For example:  
     - If \( n = 100 \), \( \sqrt{n} = 10 \), so SEM = \( \sigma / 10 \).  
     - If \( n = 10,000 \), \( \sqrt{n} = 100 \), so SEM = \( \sigma / 100 \).  

3. **Visualization**:  
   ![Standard Error vs Sample Size](https://www.statisticshowto.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/standard-error-formula.png)  
   - As \( n \) increases, the SEM curve flattens, showing diminishing returns.

---

### **Practical Implications**
1. **Tighter Error Bars**:  
   - Smaller SEM â†’ narrower confidence intervals â†’ more precise estimates.

2. **Sample Size Planning**:  
   - To halve SEM, you need to quadruple \( n \) (since \( \sqrt{4n} = 2\sqrt{n} \)).

3. **Statistical Significance**:  
   - Larger \( n \) makes it easier to detect small effects (e.g., in A/B testing).

---

### **Example**
Suppose \( \sigma = 10 \):

| Sample Size (\( n \)) | SEM (\( \sigma / \sqrt{n} \)) | Error Bar Width (95% CI â‰ˆ 2Ã—SEM) |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| 100                   | \( 10 / 10 = 1 \)             | Â±2                                |
| 400                   | \( 10 / 20 = 0.5 \)           | Â±1                                |
| 10,000                | \( 10 / 100 = 0.1 \)          | Â±0.2                              |

---

### **Key Takeaway**
- **Error bars tighten as \( n \) grows** because SEM shrinks.  
- This reflects increasing confidence in the sample mean as a reliable estimate of the population mean.  

Does this clarify the connection between sample size, standard error, and error bars?
