All these smells are incomplete or incorrect application of object-oriented programming principles

What code smell falls into the "object-orientation" abusers, if:
- You have a complex `switch` operator or sequence of `if` statements.
- Temporary fields get their values (and thus are needed by objects) only under certain circumstances. Outside of these circumstances, they’re empty.
- If a subclass uses only some of the methods and properties inherited from its parents
- Several classes perform identical functions but have different method names
