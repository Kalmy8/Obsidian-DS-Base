For discrete random variables (like the outcome of rolling a die), we can calculate the probability that the random variable takes on a specific value. This is called the **probability mass function (PMF)**, which gives the probability of each possible value.
>[!Example]
if $X$ is a random variable representing the roll of a fair six-sided die, then $P(X = 3) = \frac{1}{6}$, because each outcome  of the random variable has an equal chance of $\frac{1}{6}$.
