a variable which has **discrete distribution**, e.g. it can take only some certain values from some interval. Some common examples would be:

Some common-used visualization techniques for such variables would be: [piecharts](piecharts.md), [barplots](barplots.md)

On practice, a discrete variable can be treated as a [continuous variable](continuous%20variable.md), if number of observations is high and the variance of the data is high. Imagine that you have a concert hall with people all of different ages from 1 to 60, and all ages are well-presented. 

In such sense, **a discrete variable is more like a characteristic of your dataset** and not of the nature of the original variable.
