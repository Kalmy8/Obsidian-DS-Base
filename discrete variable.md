a variable which has **discrete distribution**, e.g. it can take only some certain values from some interval. Some common examples would be:
- Age measured by years (1/2/3 and so on)
- Hour of the day (1/2/3/4PM)
- Flat floor (1-10) 
- Outcomes of a rolling dice (1-6)
- Number of students in the class (10-25)
- ...

Some common-used visualization techniques for such variables would be: [[piecharts]], [[barplots]]

On practice, a discrete variable can be treated as a [[continuous variable]], if number of observations is high and the variance of the data is high. Imagine that you have a class with people all of different ages from 1 to 60, and all ages are well-presented.  

In such sense, **a discrete variable is more like a characteristic of your dataset** and not of the nature of the original variable.
