allow you to create subsamples of the original dataset with ability to prognose how will the descriptive statistic change because of such operation

| **Technique**            | **Key Idea**                        | **Pros**                        | **Cons**                             |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Bagging**              | Random samples with replacement     | Easy, variance reduction        | May not reduce covariance completely |
| **Subsampling**          | Random samples without replacement  | Reduces dependence              | Can leave out data points entirely   |
| **Stratified Sampling**  | Maintains class proportions         | Good for imbalanced datasets    | Adds complexity                      |
| **Jackknife Resampling** | Excludes one data point at a time   | Theoretically robust            | Computationally expensive            |
| **Boosting Sampling**    | Weighted sampling for hard examples | Reduces bias and variance       | Prone to overfitting and noise       |
| **Random Subspace**      | Samples columns instead of rows     | Great for high-dimensional data | Needs large feature space            |
| **Cluster Sampling**     | Samples within pre-defined clusters | Ensures diverse subsets         | Relies on good clustering            |
