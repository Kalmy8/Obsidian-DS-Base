What is a **Memento pattern** design pattern? When is it useful and how would you know if you will benefit from utilizng it? Provide some mock-code example of a class designed within a **Memento** paradigm.

[Memento.mhtml](Memento.mhtml)
The **Memento pattern** is a [behavioral pattern](Behavioral%20patterns.md) which **special purpose is to save, store and revert some object's state** in a safe way (without exposing it's private fields).
##### Memento pattern structure
![Pasted image 20240904122535.png](Pasted%20image%2020240904122535.png)
The pattern itself consists of **4 main parts**:
1. **Originator:** the original object which state we do want to save and revert. So, the originator has to implement `save()` and `restore(memento)` methods which will create the **Concrete Memento \[3]** and restore it's state from the memento when needed.
2. **Memento (ABC):** abstract class declaring an interface for **only Memento-Caretaker\[2]** relationships, so the client won't be able to obtain hidden state which is stored inside a Memento, but will be able to use all other merhods returning additional information like `get_name(self)`, `get_date(self)`...
3. **Concrete Memento:** a subclass of **Memento \[2]**, which **implements all the defined methods plus one method that will be responsible for Memento-Originator relationship**. It is usually called something like `get_state(self)` and should return a hidden state that was passed to a memento during it's creation.
4. **Caretaker:** utility class actually implementing operations with saved Mementos, like re-doing, un-doing, making backups and showing history.
##### Memento pattern mock-code example
```python
class Originator:
    """
    The Originator holds some important state that may change 
    over time. It also defines a method for saving the state 
    inside a memento and another method for restoring the state 
    from it.
    """
    
    _state = None
    """
    For the sake of simplicity, the originator's state is 
    stored inside a single variable.
    """

    def __init__(self, state: str) -> None:
        self._state = state
        print(f"Originator: My initial state is: {self._state}")

    def do_something(self) -> None:
        """
        The Originator's business logic may affect its 
        internal state. Therefore, the client should backup 
        the state before launching methods of the business 
        logic via the save() method.
        """

        print("Originator: I'm doing something important.")
