What are the **Behavioral patterns**? Why are they called so, and what exact patterns do fit this category?
?
These patterns deal with how objects interact and how responsibilities are assigned. Examples include:
* **[Chain of Responsibility pattern](Chain%20of%20Responsibility%20pattern.md):** Avoids coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving multiple objects a chance to handle the request.
* **[Command pattern](Command%20pattern.md):** Encapsulates a request as an object.
* **[Iterator pattern](Iterator%20pattern.md):** Provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially.
* **[Mediator pattern](Mediator%20pattern.md):** Defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact.
* **[Memento pattern](Memento%20pattern.md):** Captures and externalizes an object's internal state.
* **[Observer pattern](Observer%20pattern.md):** Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified.
* **[State pattern](State%20pattern.md):** Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.
* **[Strategy pattern](Strategy%20pattern.md):** Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
* **[Template Method pattern](Template%20Method%20pattern.md):** Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses.
* **[Visitor pattern](Visitor%20pattern.md):** Represents an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure.
