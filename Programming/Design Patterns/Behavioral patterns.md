What are the **Behavioral patterns**? Why are they called so, and what exact patterns do fit this category?
?
These patterns deal with how objects interact and how responsibilities are assigned. Examples include:
* **[[Chain of Responsibility pattern]]:** Avoids coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving multiple objects a chance to handle the request.
* **[[Command pattern]]:** Encapsulates a request as an object.
* **[[Iterator pattern]]:** Provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially.
* **[[Mediator pattern]]:** Defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact.
* **[[Memento pattern]]:** Captures and externalizes an object's internal state.
* **[[Observer pattern]]:** Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified.
* **[[State pattern]]:** Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.
* **[[Strategy pattern]]:** Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
* **[[Template Method pattern]]:** Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses.
* **[[Visitor pattern]]:** Represents an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure.
