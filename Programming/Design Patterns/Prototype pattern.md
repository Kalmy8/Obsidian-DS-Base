#üÉè/design_patterns
What is a **Prototype** design pattern? When is it useful and how would you know if you will benefit from utilizng it? Provide some mock-code example of a class designed within a **Prototype** paradigm.
?
The **Prototype** desing pattern allows you to create some class instances by using no common initialization techniques, but instead by copying from some base (prototype) instance. This might be useful if:
1. Going through class **\__init\__** routine is computationally expensive or time-consuming.
2. You have a lot of slighlty different typical objects in your application. In that case, copying will prevent you from **extensive subclassing**, when you want to avoid creating a large hierarchy of classes to represent slight variations of objects.
3. **Complex Object Configurations**: When objects are complex and their initial setup involves many configurations or dependencies, it might be easier to clone a pre-configured prototype rather than recreate it.
------------------------------------------------------------
Prototype desing pattern example:
```python
from copy import deepcopy

class Monster:
    def __init__(self, name, health, attack):
        self.name = name
        self.health = health
        self.attack = attack

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.name} (Health: {self.health}, Attack: {self.attack})"

# Create prototype monsters
prototype_monsters = {
    "goblin": Monster("Goblin", 20, 5),
    "troll": Monster("Troll", 50, 10),
    "dragon": Monster("Dragon", 100, 20),
}

# Function to spawn a monster from a prototype
def spawn_monster(monster_type):
    prototype = prototype_monsters.get(monster_type)
    if prototype:
        return deepcopy(prototype) # Create a deep copy of the prototype
    else:
        raise ValueError(f"Invalid monster type: {monster_type}")

# Usage
goblin1 = spawn_monster("goblin")
goblin2 = spawn_monster("goblin")

print(goblin1)  # Output: Goblin (Health: 20, Attack: 5)
print(goblin2)  # Output: Goblin (Health: 20, Attack: 5)
```

## Practical tasks:

1. **Game NPC Spawner**
    - Define a¬†`NPC`¬†class with¬†`health`,¬†`attack`, and¬†`ai_behavior`.
    - Use a prototype registry to clone pre-configured NPCs (e.g., "Archer", "Mage") instead of reinitializing.
