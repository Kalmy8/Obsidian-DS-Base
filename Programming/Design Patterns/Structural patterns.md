What are the **Structural patterns**? Why are they called so, and what exact patterns do fit this category?
?
These patterns deal with how classes and objects are composed into larger structures. Examples include:
* **[Adapter pattern](Adapter%20pattern.md):** Converts the interface of a class into another interface clients expect.
* **[Bridge pattern](Bridge%20pattern.md):** Decouples an abstraction from its implementation.
* **[Composite pattern](Composite%20pattern.md):** Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
* **[Decorator pattern](Decorator%20pattern.md):** Dynamically adds responsibilities to an object.
* **[Facade pattern](Facade%20pattern.md):** Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.
* **[Flyweight pattern](Flyweight%20pattern.md):** Shares objects to support large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently.
* **[Proxy pattern](Proxy%20pattern.md):** Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.
