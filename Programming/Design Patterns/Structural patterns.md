What are the **Structural patterns**? Why are they called so, and what exact patterns do fit this category?
?
These patterns deal with how classes and objects are composed into larger structures. Examples include:
* **[[Adapter pattern]]:** Converts the interface of a class into another interface clients expect.
* **[[Bridge pattern]]:** Decouples an abstraction from its implementation.
* **[[Composite pattern]]:** Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
* **[[Decorator pattern]]:** Dynamically adds responsibilities to an object.
* **[[Facade pattern]]:** Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.
* **[[Flyweight pattern]]:** Shares objects to support large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently.
* **[[Proxy pattern]]:** Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.
