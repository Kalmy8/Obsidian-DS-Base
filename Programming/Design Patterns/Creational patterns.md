What are the **Creational patterns**? Why are they called so, and what exact patterns do fit this category?
?
These design patterns handle the object creation process, optimizing the flexibility and reusability of the code. Following patterns do fall in this category:
- **[[Abstract Factory pattern]]:** Provides an interface for creating families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- **[[Builder pattern]]:** Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation.
- **[[Factory pattern]]:** Defines an interface for creating objects, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
- **[[Prototype pattern]]:** Specifies the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance.
- **[[Singletone pattern]]:** Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
