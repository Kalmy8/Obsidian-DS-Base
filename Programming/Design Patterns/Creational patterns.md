What are the **Creational patterns**? Why are they called so, and what exact patterns do fit this category?
?
These design patterns handle the object creation process, optimizing the flexibility and reusability of the code. Following patterns do fall in this category:
- **[Abstract Factory pattern](Abstract%20Factory%20pattern.md):** Provides an interface for creating families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- **[Builder pattern](Builder%20pattern.md):** Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation.
- **[Factory pattern](Factory%20pattern.md):** Defines an interface for creating objects, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
- **[Prototype pattern](Prototype%20pattern.md):** Specifies the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance.
- **[Singletone pattern](Singletone%20pattern.md):** Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
