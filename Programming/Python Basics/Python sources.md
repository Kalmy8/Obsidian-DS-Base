**General Python Practice (Great for Basics and for/while loop practice):**

- **Exercism:** (exercism.org) Offers a huge variety of coding exercises with automated feedback and mentoring. It's excellent for structured practice. It also contains different tracks so you can create something like homework for your students for different weeks
    
- **PracticePython.org:** Beginner-friendly exercises with clear explanations. A great starting point for those new to Python. Focuses primarily on pure python constructions
    
- **CodingBat:** (codingbat.com) Provides a wide range of problems organized by difficulty. The immediate feedback is great for identifying errors. Good for loops and function practice
    
- **HackerRank:** (hackerrank.com) More algorithm-focused and can be suitable when covering more complex algorithm principles (sorting, searching, etc)
    
- **LeetCode:** (leetcode.com) Geared towards interview preparation, so often problems are quite tricky/complex. The problems get more complex over time so it might help engage more talented students
    
- **CheckiO:** (checkio.org) Game-like exercises suitable for basic python as it helps creating a soft start within your classes
    
- **Codewars:** (codewars.com) Another great resource for interview preparation, very similar to leetcode and hackerrank. Similar to HackerRank and LeetCode, but with more varied tasks
