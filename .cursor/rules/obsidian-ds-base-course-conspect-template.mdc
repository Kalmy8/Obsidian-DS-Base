Overall Structure:
1. Codewords/Keywords section
2. Theoretical material
3. Immediate practice problems with concrete tasks and expected outputs
4. More theoretical material
5. More practice problems
6. End with hashtag and key questions section

Format Details:

For Codewords/Keywords:
- Appears at the top of the document
- Format: **Codewords:** keyword1, keyword2, keyword3, etc.

For Theoretical Material:
- Organized with ## for main sections and ### for subsections
- Each concept is explained with code examples
- Code examples use ```python blocks
- Examples use consistent sample data (often student information)
- When introducing a new method/concept, provide clear examples of usage

For Practice Problems:
- Follow immediately after theoretical sections
- Include toy DataFrame creation code for every practice problem
- Format: **Practice Problem: [Topic]**
- Include concrete tasks with numbered items and comprehensible output
- Make tasks progressively more challenging
- Use realistic examples related to the concept being taught
- Tasks should FULLY cover the theoretical matherial

For Key Questions Section:
- Located at the end of the document
- Questions SHOULD FULLY COVER theoretical material
- Questions SHOULD BE FORMULATED CLEARLY, so each question has one obvious answer
- Format: #🃏/pandas-basics (hashtag with clown emoji)
- Questions follow a specific format:
  ```
  **Key Questions:**
  
  1. Question text?
  ?
  - Answer details with proper formatting, preferably with bullet points
  ```

Additional Preferences:
- Try to include toy DataFrame creation code once and share it for later theory/problem blocks (if reasonable)
- Do not let practice problems copy the theory section material: they must challenge the same 
knowledge, but look different
- Make problems concrete with specified expected outputs
- Have more frequent practice sections (after each concept)
- Use real-world-like column names (like grade_math_midterm instead of just column1)
- For complex concepts like regex, provide more elaborate examples
- Keep your answers very minimalistic: I am working fast and I don't want to spend time reading your reasoning
