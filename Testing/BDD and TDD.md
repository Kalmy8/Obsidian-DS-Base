- BDD stands for Behavior Driven Development
	- **Outside in:** This approach assumes that you have no information about the underlaying code or mechanism (imagine you are the user):
		- If I add an item to my shopping cart - will it appear on the checkout page?
		- If I like that song - will it appear in my "Liked songs" playlist?
	- **Simple syntax:** are formulated using the high-level language, so can be understood by the developers, the stakeholders and the users
- TDD stands for Test Driven Development
	- **Inside  out:** This approach assumes that you have a holistic view of how should your code behave (imagine you are the developer):
		- What should that method return in cases 1, 2,3...?
		- What data should I receive from that API...?
		- How would the system behave if ValueError occurs?
- Both approaches complement each other to ensure that:
	- BDD: you are building "the right thing"
	- TDD: you are building "that thing right"
