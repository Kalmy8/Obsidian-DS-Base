# Refactoring Guru - Design Patterns Course

**Course Description:**
Comprehensive guide to design patterns based on Refactoring Guru resources. Covers creational, structural, and behavioral design patterns with practical examples in Python. Helps developers write maintainable, flexible, and reusable code.

## Course Structure

### Overview

- [[Refactoring Guru - Design Patterns]] - Main course overview and introduction

### Creational Patterns

Patterns for object creation mechanisms:

- [[Creational patterns]] - Overview of creational patterns
- [[Abstract Factory pattern]] - Creating families of related objects
- [[Builder pattern]] - Constructing complex objects step by step
- [[Factory pattern]] - Creating objects without specifying exact classes
- [[Prototype pattern]] - Cloning objects instead of creating new ones
- [[Singletone pattern]] - Ensuring only one instance exists

### Structural Patterns

Patterns for composing objects into larger structures:

- [[Structural patterns]] - Overview of structural patterns
- [[Adapter pattern]] - Making incompatible interfaces work together
- [[Bridge pattern]] - Separating abstraction from implementation
- [[Composite pattern]] - Composing objects into tree structures
- [[Decorator pattern]] - Adding behavior to objects dynamically
- [[Facade pattern]] - Providing a simplified interface to complex subsystems
- [[Flyweight pattern]] - Sharing state to reduce memory usage
- [[Proxy pattern]] - Controlling access to objects

### Behavioral Patterns

Patterns for communication between objects:

- [[Behavioral patterns]] - Overview of behavioral patterns
- [[Chain of Responsibility pattern]] - Passing requests along a chain of handlers
- [[Command pattern]] - Encapsulating requests as objects
- [[Iterator pattern]] - Traversing collections without exposing structure
- [[Mediator pattern]] - Reducing coupling between objects
- [[Memento pattern]] - Saving and restoring object state
- [[Observer pattern]] - Notifying multiple objects about state changes
- [[State pattern]] - Changing object behavior based on state
- [[Strategy pattern]] - Defining a family of algorithms
- [[Template Method pattern]] - Defining algorithm skeleton in base class
- [[Visitor pattern]] - Adding operations to object structures

### Special Patterns

- [[Active Record and Repository pattern]] - Data access patterns

## Learning Path

1. Start with pattern categories overview (Creational, Structural, Behavioral)
2. Learn fundamental patterns in each category
3. Understand when to use each pattern
4. Practice implementing patterns in Python
5. Recognize pattern opportunities in real code

## Key Concepts Covered

- **Design Patterns**: Reusable solutions to common problems
- **Creational Patterns**: Object creation mechanisms
- **Structural Patterns**: Object composition
- **Behavioral Patterns**: Object communication
- **Pattern Selection**: Choosing the right pattern for the problem
- **Python Implementation**: Applying patterns in Python
