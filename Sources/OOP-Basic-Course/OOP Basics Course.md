1. **Introduction to OOP**
   - [[OOP Basics (1st) lesson]] - OOP intuition, motivation, detecting objects, classes and instances

2. **Classes and Objects**
   - [[OOP Basics (2nd) lesson]] - Class definition, attributes, methods

3. **Inheritance**
   - [[OOP Basics (3rd) lesson]] - Inheritance concepts, parent-child relationships

2. Learning to identify objects in your code
3. Creating classes and instances
4. Mastering inheritance and relationships
5. Exploring advanced OOP concepts
6. Applying OOP in practical scenarios

## Key Concepts Covered

- **Objects**: Entities with data (attributes) and operations (methods)
- **Classes**: Blueprints for creating objects
- **Inheritance**: Creating new classes based on existing ones
- **Encapsulation**: Bundling data and methods together
- **Polymorphism**: Using objects of different types through a common interface
