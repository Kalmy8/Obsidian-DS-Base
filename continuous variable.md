 a variable which has **continuous distribution**, e.g. it can take arbitrary numeric values from some interval. Some common examples would be:
- Height (any number from 50cm to 220cm)
- Weight (any number from 40kg to 150kg)
- Salary 
- Distance
- Temperature
- ...
Some common-used visualization techniques for such variables would be: [[histograms]], [[boxplots]], [[scatterplots]]

On practice, a continuous variable can be treated as a [[discrete variable]], if number of observations is small and the measurements are clearly separable from each other (imagine that the measurements were done with some inaccurate device, for example a thermometer which could only show you 0/10/20/30 degrees).

In such sense, **a continuous variable is more like a characteristic of your dataset** and not of the nature of the original variable.   

Continuous variables can be truly transformed to discrete ones using the [[binning technique]].
