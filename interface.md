is an agreement on how should the object interact with the rest of the world

Examples:
- For a car, pedal, steering wheel, all the buttons and handbreak together are the interface
	- Note: lots of cars will align with this single common interface. In such sense, the materials of buttons, their relative positions, sensors used under the hood, colors and details, forms and printings can be different - the interface though stays the same
		- We could say that the interface is more about an idea and functionality, not about exact details
	- However, cars with automatic and manual selectors have different interfaces: first one has less pedals
	- Also, some cars does not have a handbrake, so their interface is also different
- For computer, the interface is the mouse and the keypad (you interact with them to communicate with computer)
